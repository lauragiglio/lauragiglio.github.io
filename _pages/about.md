About me
======
I'm interested in the neural processes that allow for sentence structure building at the interface of syntax and thematic role structure. In particular, during my PhD I aimed to characterize the neural responses to these processes in sentence production while systematically comparing them to comprehension, in an attempt to comprehend to what extent linguistic representations and processes are shared when speaking and listening. To this aim, I use fMRI data and several analysis techniques. In current postdoctoral work, I aim to understand how these processes are affected by stroke.

In previous research, I used EEG to learn about the consequences of prediction disconfirmation on memory representations.
